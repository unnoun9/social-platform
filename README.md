# Social Platform, A cool Social Media Site

- *Incomplete Project*
- Made to apply and learn a SQL Database.
- Not hosted anywhere as of right now.

## Dependencies and Tools
- Python
- Flask
- Jinja
- MySQL
- HTML & CSS (Bootstrap)

## Build process
- Assuming python, flask, and MySQL is properly setup, run `python app.py` in a terminal. That's it.
- `ddl_sql_quries` has the queries to make all tables for the database in MySQL. Make sure to run those too!
